# Cards client

## Installation

There is no installation for the game but for the webserver. Execute:

```
npm install
```

## Running

```
gulp serve
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Open two different tabs and play around.

I'm thinking to add this client into the cards-server code to server everything from one single place.
