# Cards client

This still needs love. There is no installation and there is no webserver to serve the client.html, so I just go to
the cards-client folder and inside, execute:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Open two different tabs and play around.

I'm thinking to add these files (client) into the cards-server code to server everything from one single place.
